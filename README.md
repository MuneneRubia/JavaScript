These implementations are for demonstrative purposes only. Dedicated implementations of these algorithms and data structures are much better for performance and security reasons. We also do not provide any guarantee for api stability. 
Before contributing to this repository, make sure to read our Contribution Guidelines. You can look at other TheAlgorithms Repositories or the issues with a "help wanted" label for inspiration regarding what to implement. Our maintainers will guide you through how to make your contribution properly if you make any mistakes. The names of the maintainers of this repository are listed in the CODEOWNERS file.

You can find a list of the algorithms currently in the repository in the directory. Explanations of many of the algorithms can be found in the wiki.
